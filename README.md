This repository contains the files needed for the exercises in the *Machine Translation* course at UZH in 2019.

## ex4

In this exercise we had to train a language model with RNN on Google Cloud Platform. The folder contains the following files:

- **preprocessing_input.py**: This is the code I used to pre-process the training data for the language model.
- **report.md**: A short report describing the dataset I used, what pre-processing steps I performed, what hyperparameters I used and what my intentions were.
- **sample_text.txt**: Sample text containing 1500 units generated by my trained language model.
- **loss_overview.png**: Screenshot of the loss overview of the second training on Tensorboard.
- **schema.png**: Image of a schema representing the RNN language model, visualised as I understand it looks like.
